Tic Tac Toe Project Spring 24' 

The game is played on a 3x3 grid represented by the whole numbers 1-9 with the same rules as the regular tic tac toe game, (1 being top right, 2 being top middle, and 3 being top right etc...)


To play the game you simply input the number that corresponds to the square of your desire.
