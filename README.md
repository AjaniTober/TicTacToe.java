Tic Tac Toe Project - Spring 2024
Overview
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Project for Spring 2024! This simple yet engaging game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each cell is represented by the whole numbers 1-9. The game follows the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe, providing an enjoyable experience for players of all levels.

Game Rules
The game board is a 3x3 grid, and each cell is identified by a unique number from 1 to 9.
Players take turns to place their symbol (X or O) on the board.
The first player to achieve a row, column, or diagonal with three of their symbols wins.
If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Player Symbols
X is represented by the color red.
O is represented by the color blue.
How to Play
Input the number corresponding to the square where you want to place your symbol.

The numbering starts from the top-left corner and goes from left to right, top to bottom (1-9).
For example, 1 represents the top-left corner, 5 represents the center, and 9 represents the bottom-right corner.
The game will update the board accordingly, and it will switch to the next player's turn.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
